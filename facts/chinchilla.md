# Chinchilla

- Chinchilla fur has the highest density of any land
  animal with more than 20,000 hairs per square centimeter.

- Many mammals grow just one hair from each follicle, but the
  chinchilla has more than 50 hairs in a single follicle.
- Chinchillas can’t take traditional baths — instead, they bathe in volcanic ash or fine dust to keep their fur clean.
  Their ultra-dense fur traps moisture easily, so water baths could lead to fungus or skin issues. A dust bath absorbs oils and dirt, keeping their coat fluffy and healthy.
